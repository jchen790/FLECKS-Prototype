# FLECKS Prototype

A simple prototype for the FLECKS project.

## Background

This prototype was built for a UF CISE Senior Design Project. This is a prototype of the audio data collection portion of the FLECKS Project. As students interact with the programming environment (simulated by the client), the environment will record their conversation and send it back to the server for further analysis. The server can then send audio feedback so that the students can learn and grow.
